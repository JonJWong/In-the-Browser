# JS-the-groove
  Welcome to JS the groove! This is a fun and interactive Javascript based rhythm game where you have to hit the arrows on screen when they reach the targets. There will be a song selected, and multiple difficulties per song.
  
  The arrows will come up the screen, according to the rhythm of the song, and depending on how close to the beat you press they correct key, you will be rewarded more points. Your final score will be shown to you once you pass a song, but if your lifebar reaches 0 from missing too many notes in succession, you will fail!
#
## Features

- Users can select a difficulty for the current song
- When the song finishes, they will be shown a summary screen which has their gameplay stats, like points and judgements
- Users can mute/unmute the song audio, as well as restart the song with a button
